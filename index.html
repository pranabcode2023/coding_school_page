            Originally from Spain, Raúl came to Berlin one day and loved the
            city so much that it's being already 10 years working and living
            here. Studied Economics in Salamanca, and worked for various
            international pharmaceutical companies, and also led his own
            start-up to success. In this city, he discovered not only the
            kneipen with the cheapest beer, but also his passion about Coding,
            so he decided to change his career and jump into it . As a web
            mentor, he will coach you with knowledge, patience and almost
            inexhaustible good humour. Besides coding, he is also a passionate
            cook and diver, and he will happily organize you the most amazing
            travel around Spain. Catch-phrase "Smells like cinnamon, but it is
            poison, but it smells like cinnamon…" Favorite spot "Any U8 Stop
            after Feierabend." Fun fact "He can cook a steak for 48 hours, to be

            Arjun is a people-centric storyteller proficient in analyzing market
            insights and tactfully developing successful content strategies. His
            strengths are his broad skill-set covering the analytical and
            creative spectrum. Making sense of raw data and then using a subset
            of practical production skills allowed him to deliver over 250+
            multimedia projects within the last 10 years. Overtime, he realized
            he loved making content for himself which led him to pivot to data
            science full-time so that he can focus on keeping all that creative
            vision to himself. He enjoys cooking intricate recipes and making
            videos of his process, loves producing comedy skits and enjoys
            fashion photography. More recently, he started improv comedy which
            he believes adds value to his daily life, however, people around him
            are skeptical of this. Catch-phrase "Na. I`mma stay all Namaste up
            in here." Favorite spot "That tiny little bar in Kotti which I
            choose to keep a secret." Fun fact "I once ate 29 boiled eggs in one
            sitting."

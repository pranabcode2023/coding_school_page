          <h2>Web Development</h2>
          <p>Create modern full stack web applications</p>
          <h3>Front-End Developer (3 Months)</h3>
          <p>In this course you will learn the fundamentals of Front-End Web Development and all the necessary tools to create your first website and Progressive Web Applications (PWA). You will use HTML and CSS to create and style the pages following your design mockups and at the end you will deploy to the world wide web. Afterward you will learn how to create interactive websites using JavaScript and responsive web applications with more advanced frameworks such as React or Vue.</p>
          <h3>Full-Stack Developer (4 Months)</h3>
          <p>In this course you will learn the same things as the previous course with the following addition. You will be in charge of creating a Back-End using Node.js, either for the application developed during the previous module or for a brand new full stack application. The stack is called M.E.R.N and it consists of the following technologies:

            M: MongoDB is a non-relational database used to store and access data
            E: Express is a middleware library used to connect our Back-End with the Front-End
            R: React is a Front-End JavaScript framework
            N: Node.js as Back-End JavaScript framework</p>
            <h3>Specialization Module (5 Months)</h3>
            <p>In this course you will learn the same things as the previous courses with the following addition. You will take part in a collaborative project and you will choose your path depending on the technologies you want to focus on:

              Gatsby: is a Front-End framework based on React that helps creating static pages pulling data from anywhere (CMS, Markdown, Databases). It has been gaining popularity recently thanks to its great SEO (search engine optimization) capabilities.
              Typescript: is a JavaScript typed language which you can use in both Front-End (JavaScript, React, Vue) and Back-End. It has always been widely used in companies because it saves you time catching errors and providing fixes before you run your code.
              In both paths you will also learn how to use GraphQL, the newest query language used in modern start-ups. At the end of the project you will have interview preparation with your mentors and code challenges that will help you in your future job search.
